    <h1>Lexicon Standoff</h1>
    <p>Welcome!</p>

    <h1>Starting a Game</h1>
    <p>A player (Host) starts a game on a phone, tablet, or computer by visiting <a href="https://lexiconstandoff.com">lexiconstandoff.com</a>.</p>
    <p>Host shares the <code>gamesecret</code> with other players, who join the game on their phone, tablet, or computer.</p>
    <p>Once all players are in the lobby, the Host starts the first Round.</p>


    <h1>Gameplay</h1>
    <p>Players are assigned a role of <strong>Agent</strong> or <strong>Imposter</strong> at the beginning of each Round. Role Distribution is as close to <strong>2 Agents</strong> to <strong>1 Imposter</strong> as possible</p>

    <p>A Round is split into four stages:</p>
    <p><a href="#turns"><strong>Turns</strong></a><br>
    Living Players take turns saying a word for two given Topics, some have better information than others.</p>
    <p><a href="#reveal"><strong>Reveal</strong></a><br>
    The two Topics are revealed to all players.</p>
    <p><a href="#actions"><strong>Actions</strong></a><br>
    Alive Players vote who to kill, dead Players elect to confuse other Players.</p>
    <p><a href="#results"><strong>Results</strong></a><br>
    Players are killed, scores are displayed.</p>

    <h2 id="turns">Turns</h2>
    <p>There are two Topics generated for the Round (eg. “Goose” &amp; “Spider”)</p>
    <p>
     <strong>Agents</strong> will only see the two Topics on their turn. <strong>Imposters</strong> will see both <em>in addition to</em> two extras. They will not know which are the real Topics and which are fake.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Agents</strong> will see “Goose” &amp; “Spider”</li>
      <li><strong>Imposters</strong> will see “Goose”, “Mountain”, “Spider”, “Computer”</li>
      <li>For any Round after the second, Players may be <em>confused</em>, in which case they will have an extra fake Topic.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>On an alive Player's turn, they must say <strong>one</strong> word they associate with both Topics.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A good word for “Goose” &amp; “Spider” would be “Web” since geese have webbed feet and spiders make webs.</li>
      <li>Words cannot be repeated by other players.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This round should be completely silent aside from Players saying their word. After every player says their one word, the Host will move the game to the <strong>Reveal</strong> stage.</p>

    <h2 id="reveal">Reveal</h2>

    <p>All Players will be see the real two Topics on their device. Players can ask other players why they chose their word.</p>
    <p><strong>Agents</strong> are trying to figure out who are <strong>Imposters</strong> and vice versa. You want your team to survive. Everyone is trying to appear confident in their decision and find their teammates.</p>

    <p>Players may give any explanation as to why they chose their word, even if it is a lie. This is about trying to figure out who is on your team, not about who chose the best word.</p>

    <p>For any Round after the second (if there are enough Players for a third), players that were <em>confused</em> by other Players may explain their selection relative to the extra word they were presented (the <em>Topic of Confusion</em>). There will be a single <strong>Key Master</strong> randomly selected by the game each Round. This Player can be alive or dead, but will have known the <em>Topic of Confusion</em> during the Turns stage. Any Player claiming to be confused in the previous stage can be verified or debunked by the <strong>Key Master</strong>. However, any Player can claim to have been the <strong>Key Master</strong> and the <strong>Key Master</strong> is allowed to lie about the <em>Topic of Confusion</em>.</p>


    <h2 id="actions">Actions</h2>
    <p>Every living Player votes on their device for who they want to kill.</p>
    <p>Every dead Player selects a Player to confuse. The next Round, that Player will have an extra fake Topic. On the last Round, dead Players are also voting to kill a Player with everyone else.</p>
    <p>After every Player submits their action, the Round will progress on its own.</p>


    <h2 id="results">Results</h2>
      <p>Players receiving the most votes are killed, even when there is a tie.</p>
      <p>The Round is over when:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Imposters</strong> win (only <strong>Imposters</strong> remain)</li>
        <li><strong>Agents</strong> win (only <strong>Agents</strong> remain)</li>
        <li>Everyone dies</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If the Round is still active:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Scoring</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Surviving <strong>Imposters</strong>  receive two points</li>
            <li>Surviving <strong>Agents</strong> receive one point</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Players <em>keep</em> their role for the next round so they should not reveal it at this time.</li>
        <li>Two new Topics are generated and the game will start another <strong>Turns</strong> stage for the survivors.</li>
        <li>The next alive Player clockwise of the Host goes first. Rotate this first turn every Round.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If the Round is over:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Scoring</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Surviving <strong>Imposters</strong>  receive two points</li>
            <li>Surviving <strong>Agents</strong> receive one point</li>
            <li>If one group wins, all Players on that team receive three points. For example:
              <ul>
                <li>If two of three <strong>Agents</strong> survive, all three <strong>Agents</strong> receive three additional points</li>
                <li>If two of three <strong>Imposters</strong> survive, all three <strong>Imposters</strong> receive three additional points</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>If everyone dies, no one receives the extra points.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Imposters</strong> are revealed at this time.</li>
        <li>Game Standings will be displayed</li>
        <li>The Host can start a new Round which will assign new roles for each Player, or they can end the Game.</li>
     </ul>

    <h1>Strategy</h1>
    <p><strong>Agents</strong> want to be discreet in their selection so as not to make it obvious to the <strong>Imposters</strong> what the two Topics are, but also specific enough so that fellow <strong>Agents</strong> will trust them.</p>
    <p><strong>Imposters</strong> will try and figure out which two Topics are the real Topics based on how <strong>Agents</strong> answer the question, but also be abstract enough with their selection so that they can defend their choice when the Topics are revealed.</p>
    <p>Any Player can claim to have been the <strong>Key Master</strong> for the Round, but they better have a good answer when asked what the <em>Topic of Confusion</em> was. You can claim the <em>Topic of Confusion</em> was anything that makes another Player look bad or to help players trust another.</p>
    <p>If you are <em>confused</em> by another Player, but are also the <strong>Key Master</strong>, you can use your knowledge of the <em>Topic of Confusion</em> to help determine what the two Topics are for the Round.</p>
